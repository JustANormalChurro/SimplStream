## üåü Introduction

Welcome to **SimplStream**, the revolutionary free and open-source streaming platform designed for the modern viewer who craves endless entertainment without the hassle of subscriptions, ads, or complexity. Born from a solo developer's passion for accessible media, SimplStream aggregates a massive library of movies, TV shows, and live channels into one intuitive, browser-based app. Whether you're binge-watching the latest Netflix hit, catching a Premier League match, or discovering hidden gems with our "Surprise Me" feature, SimplStream puts you in control.

In a world dominated by fragmented streaming services ‚Äì where you need a separate app for Disney, another for Hulu, and yet another for sports ‚Äì SimplStream breaks the mold. It pulls together mainstream content from across the ecosystem (think *Stranger Things* from Netflix, *The Mandalorian* from Disney+, *The Boys* from Prime Video, and more) via reliable third-party embeds, all while keeping things 100% free. No paywalls, no regional blocks, just pure streaming bliss optimized for desktops, mobiles, tablets, and even 4K TVs.

Launched on October 16, 2025, as version 1.0, SimplStream is more than an app ‚Äì it's a movement toward democratized entertainment. Built with love by [Andy](https://github.com/JustANormalChurro) (aka JustANormalChurro), this project invites you to star, fork, and contribute to make it even better. Dive in, and let the credits roll!
